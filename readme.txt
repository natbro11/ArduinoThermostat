
Frustrated by an antiquated bimetallic thermostat controlling heat in my apartment, I created an arduino program to operate the heat both more comfortably and more efficiently. 
The old thermostat lacks precision and responsiveness, causing it to run very long heat cycle times leading to discomfort and inefficient heating. 
Our heat is hot water baseboard radiators that recieve heat in less than a minute after a call for heat. This allows simple arduino controls to maintain heat very precisely.
